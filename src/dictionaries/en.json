Due to the Corona pandemic, scanning QR codes and filling out documents via one's own smartphone have arrived in the middle of society. However, a tablet can be added on request. This means patients only need a phone with text messaging capability. If patients do not have a smartphone at all, paper can still be used in addition to Nelly."
